🎓 Student Pass/Fail Predictor – Machine Learning Project

“Predicting student outcomes with data-driven insights!”

This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail a course based on features like study hours, attendance, assignments, and internal marks using Logistic Regression. It’s a practical example of classification, data analysis, and visualization.

🚀 Project Overview

Objective: Predict student pass/fail outcomes to help educators and institutions identify at-risk students early.

Approach: Use Logistic Regression to classify students as pass (1) or fail (0).

Skills Applied:

Python, Pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, train-test split)

Data cleaning, feature selection, and preprocessing

Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

📊 Dataset

Synthetic dataset contains the following features:

Feature	Type	Description
Study Hours	Numeric	Average hours per week spent studying
Attendance (%)	Numeric	Class attendance percentage
Assignments Submitted	Binary	1 = Yes, 0 = No
Internal Marks	Numeric	Internal assessment marks
Pass/Fail	Binary	1 = Pass, 0 = Fail (Target)

Rows: 200 synthetic student records

Purpose: Practice ML classification workflow

🧰 How It Works

Load Data: Read CSV into a Pandas DataFrame.

Feature Selection: Choose numeric and binary features for prediction.

Train-Test Split: Separate 80% of data for training and 20% for testing.

Train Model: Fit Logistic Regression classifier.

Predict Outcomes: Test the model on unseen student data.

Evaluate Model: Calculate accuracy and display confusion matrix.

Visualize: Use plots to compare actual vs predicted results.
